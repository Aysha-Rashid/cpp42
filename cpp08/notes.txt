Array in c++
-> arrays are created in c++ in a contiguous form
-> how is a index calculated in a array is using (name of the array variable) + index * sizeof(the variable type)
using the standard array library we can access the 



An empty container contains no data so we need to add into it:
    - you can traverse the container in particular direction
        - by defining a begin and end which allows us to create a special object
            called iterator which allows us to identify one of the element in the array.


Stack container
    - unlike vector or any other containers, stack can not be accessed through their index rather only the top
        of the stack. That's why it is not iterable. (.top())
    - We cannot add elements during its declaration such as stack<string> car = {"Mercedes", "Ford", "toyota"};
    - to add elements to the top we use .push() and to remove the element from the top we use .pop()
